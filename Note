hey - Send me a note if you would have résumé interest in "got 20 (let's go for double the 10) installs for preventative earthquake app I published on the Google Play store using Snap (upgrade from 'via Fb', which is not necessarily as interesting rn to startups (see below) that you might apply for (presumably as a swe but if small startup may invite you to 'pull levers on growth') due to very low CPM on Snap whereas Facebook inventory is now competitive. Next Dollar Shave Club (i.e. one of the next ,,, dollar exit direct to customer brands, or, conceivably, the next ,,, app is going to be built on Snap ads (1/20 cost of fb rn) (Snap version of Wish story, Wish story was Facebook version of Amazon's Adwords story), personally think next Wish will be Alexa native so hypothesis is wouldn't grow that using Snap but rather ads on voice (know that sounds obvious but takes more than even one heavily weighted variable like the platform app is on to know where they'll buy users from) but maybe voice one will b 3 yrs out, so, for 6 mons out still Snap. Send me a note, if would like to share in the above yc-ifying of your resume (+ it's productive/'for a good cause' procrastination for me (helping people direct their worrying towards earthquakes is a good thing... i think)) at DEN? Going to be working around Hanover area 'til next week. cheers, Sam p. (back from lv and fully reformed).
