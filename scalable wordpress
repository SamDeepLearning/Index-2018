Q for Wordpress Users. I think it's high level enough to be useful to others, because it pertains to the Javascript & SEO question.

In my particular case, I have one JSON file that contains the text content for my hundreds of Wordpress posts. I am using templating, mustache.js, to insert the text content and render the posts. This allows me to efficiently bulk update parts of multiple posts in my JSON file using find and replace where I am also writing the content, rather than having to use phpMyAdmin for find and replace updates. More importantly, I can copy one piece of content from one post into other posts without having to open up each post as a browser tab from the slow Wordpress dashboard. This is a great system for me writing content, but is Google indexing the rendered posts, or is it only seeing the tags? My understanding is that on the first index, it looks at the source only, so it is indexing the tags only. If this is the case and Google is only seeing the tags, is there a relatively simple way to render the posts for Googlebot before Googlebot sees them? Is there a way to render the site as static web pages? I am using WPEngine, and it would be preferable to render static web pages when I'm ready to, so that I can make changes to the JSON file offline, without affecting the rendered site, because if the JSON file becomes invalid, every single one of my Wordpress posts will be blank. This is bad for readers obviously, but if Google indexes this, that would be even worse, because it would drop the post in the rankings and readers would no longer be able to find it.

What do you think... How are you managing lots of posts and working hand-in-hand with Google? Are you using Javascript + a JSON file or staying in the dashboard?
